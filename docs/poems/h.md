People gravitate to her as a reflex,  
She’s quite a crowd-pleaser.  
She makes friends from strangers,  
Changes adversary to well-wisher.



She likes to hug people as if  
They have never been hugged before.  
She listens to same old stories like  
She’s never listened to them before.   



She wears her heart on her sleeves,   
And pours it without thinking twice.   
She lives her life not to regret,   
Always prepared to pay the price.   



She shares her table with strangers,   
Even her plate and stories with pleasure  
Leaves an impression on everyone,   
And an experience to forever treasure.   
 


Essentially, she is a nucleus,   
And people are the electrons   
But he is the one electron for her,   
And that’s what H is made from.
