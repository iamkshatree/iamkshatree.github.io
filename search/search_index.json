So, feel free to interpret as you wish. ONE Dear E, I wonder if we could be together and live harmoniously. But as it stands, we seem to end up on the opposite sides of each other more often than not, intentionally or unintentionally. There have been times when we have managed to be on the same page but they have been so short-lived. And that makes it all the more painful knowing that magic happens when we are together. I ponder how things could be if we were together to balance each other out. While I see myself a lot more practical, you seem to be sentimental and at times over-sentimental, if I may say so. Even when there would be obvious choices, you would find at least one tiny argument to go against those and hold onto it to your dear life, not because you wanted to oppose me but because you truly believed in it. There have been occasions when you have managed to prove me or those \u201cobvious\u201d choices of mine wrong and that blew me away. But there have also been countless instances where I have been right. If only we could find the middle ground, things could be so different but then again \u2026 While I have always loved how you are so protective of your loved ones, you would also disappoint me when you held on to your sentiments obstinately even when there were plenty of reasons not to \u2013 even when I tried to make you see those reasons. While I have always admired how you stood by everything you believed in, it put me off when you cut me loose amidst all that. While I would try to reason, you would try to counter that with sentiments. You would not think twice to give people one more chance every single time while I would try to stop that. Many a times, it paid the dividends but also many of those times, your faith would not be repaid. And yet you would not change. And yet you would still be willing to dish out one more chance and that was beyond me. I am not saying that I am always right and that you\u2019re always wrong. I have messed a lot of things up trying to be rational. I have made lots of error in judgements trying to be practical casting all things aside. You have taught me more than I could have asked for and I have tried the same. And yet there is something ingrained in our systems that we tend to neglect each other most of the times. The sample size where you and I have managed to be on the same wavelength is small but so beautiful that I can\u2019t help but ask for more. I wonder if you feel anywhere close to that. I wonder if we could be in sync with each other. I wonder, do you?

Comparisons are relative, contentedness is real. If someone asks us, \u201c Which one is greater, x or y?\u201d We \u201csmartly\u201d counter-question , \u201cHow am I supposed to compare when I don't know what x and y are? Give me values.\u201d The person replies \u201cx equals 7, y equals 4\u201d Then we reply, \u201cEasy! x it is.\u201d But how often do we ask the unit(s)? It is important, right? Very important in fact. The basic principle of comparison is that the units of things being compared must be the same. And here we are capable of comparing anything with everything. And yet we compare 7 days with 4 oranges. Genius! I know it is very natural and very human to make comparisons. Sometimes, it comes as an instinct. For example, whenever we talk about Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi comes in the next breathe \u2013 whether we like it or not?- whether we want it or not. It is what it is. But when I think, it is very unfair to both of them to make comparisons. Yes, we have data and statistics of various parameters of every movement(s) and/or minute(s) of them on the pitch and we compare them on the basis of that. What we forget is that, they are 9 days off the pitch to be on the pitch the 10 th day. What I mean is, the 9 days that they spend off the field working their arse-off is what makes them who they are. The 10 th day is just the product. And the work that goes behind those 9 days can not be summed up by any parameter. They have their own routines, own work ethics and both equally effective. So, who we like better is the question we answer when asked, \u201cWho is better?\u201d We may not realise that when we say things in one light, the person on the receiving end may take in other light. Let me give you an example: Your daughter is only just learning to cook. She made you a curry. She made you taste the curry. When asked how the curry tastes, you answer \u201cTastier than the last time.\u201d Now you might say- What can possibly be wrong in that statement. Well, the mind can work different to how we think it works. Your daughter worked as eagerly on the last curry as she did for this one. It's because of the last curry that this one became tasty. But when you said \u201ctastier than last time\u201d it also means or also can be interpreted as \u201clast one was less tasty than this\u201d and what this can do is take the shine off the work she put in that day. And that can be deflating. Note that all this while, I am using the word 'can'. Yes 9/10 times, your daughter may not think the way I explained. But in saying that, 1/10 has to account for something, right? So, why compare? Why use more words when less can be as effective, if not more. \u201cTasty!\u201d would suffice. Let's look at another example. You have two sons \u2013 one excels at sports and the other at academics. But would it be fair if we compare the academics of the one good at sports with the other one's. Or the sports skill of the one good at studies with his brother's -No, right. And yet that is what we do very often. What happens in reality is even worse, we compare a boy/girl from one family growing up in a certain environment to another growing up in completely different background just because it is convenient \u2013 just because they are contemporaries or just because they are in the same class. Comparing sun with the moon is another classic example. I am the sort of person that does not like being compared to anyone else in any regards. I feel like it is insulting to me and also to the person I am compared with. I believe that no two people in the world have same unit and hence do not fit the principle of comparison -Yes some parameters such as age, height, weight can be but what I mean is there can be no general comparison. For example, when we say A is more beautiful than B \u2013 it does not make complete sense. There are no units to compare beauty, is there? What I conceive \u2018beautiful\u2019 may be completely different from your form of 'beautiful'. I say beautiful is a bodily adjective. You may say NO- if so, \u2018good looking' would mean the same as \u2018beautiful'. I say 'beautiful' is feminine. And you may say, if so how do you describe the smile of your grandfather or your kid? I feel when we compare 2 people with questions like \u2013 \u2018who is better? who is wiser?\u2019 , we do not do them full justice. We should leave them be. People need to be celebrated for their uniqueness rather than compared. The only person I liked to be compared with is the person I was yesterday, not even the day before. That also just to gain a perspective. Comparison is a cage and contentment is the key to the cage.So, what do you think - Apple or Cricket?","title":"Apple or Cricket"},{"location":"more/apple-or-cricket/#apple-or-cricket","text":"Comparisons are relative, contentedness is real.

She lives her life not to regret, Always prepared to pay the price.
